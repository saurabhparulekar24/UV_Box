# UV_Box
Sanitization has become a necessary part of everyone lives, this project provides the design files and firmware for making a PCB of the UV box

The Schematic File provided (.sch) is a Autocad Eagle Schematic File, To Use Autodesk Eagle create an Autodesk account.
NOTE: The Board File and Schematic File names should be same to perform forward and backward annotations in Eagle

Process For Creating PCB
1) Open Schematic and Board file in Eagle, You can make your own changes in the Schematic, this will render the provided board file useless. You will need to create a new board file and Route the PCB (Follow My Blog for PCB designing)
2) Generate CAM Outputs and Forware them to a PCB manufacturing

Process for Uploading Firmware

The System uses Atmega 13A Microcontroller for more details refer the datasheet:http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/doc8126.pdf
Follow the link for uploading firmware to Atemga 13A https://www.engineersgarage.com/arduino/atmel-attiny13a-with-arduino-ide/#:~:text=Select%20%E2%80%9CArduino%20as%20ISP%E2%80%9D%20from,by%20pressing%20the%20upload%20button.

The Repository will be updated with new files
